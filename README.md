I am deeply interested in various fields of computer science and am actively learning a few of them. Till now, I have gotten involved with web programming, machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning along with some devops tools like Git, Docker, and have deployed a few of my projects on various resources like AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP and Firebase. I am also interested in learning about space and how computers can be effectively used to innovate and improve our advancements in the same.
